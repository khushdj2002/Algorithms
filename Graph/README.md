# Breadth First Search or BFS 

## The Breadth- first search (BFS) algorithm is used to search a tree or graph DS for a node that meets a set of criteria. It starts at the trees root or graph and searches/visits all nodes at the current depth level before moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. 

## It is same as BFS in tree bt in graph may contain cycles.
## So we divide the vertices into Visited and Not visited

## BFS uses a Queue DS for traversal.
